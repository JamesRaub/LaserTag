= Inspiration
== Jason has been interested in game development, so we decided to go back and forth pitching game ideas to each other until we found one that seemed right.

== What it does
== The game takes the color of the enemy shirt for both players, then creates a hitscan shot by tapping the screen. The eliminated player == will be notified via text message (both players must enter each other's phone numbers prior to starting).

== How we built it
== We used the Android Studio and open-source code to create an AR experience, then added in our own graphics and logic.

== Challenges we ran into
== Despite our knowledge of Java, we are both high school students with no previous experience in Android, which required a lot of 
== learning on-the-spot. We also had to exclude a few of the more complicated features we hoped to include in order to enhance the core 
== foundations of the game.

== Accomplishments that we're proud of
== We're proud to have developed an app as complicated as we did without prior experience with Android.

== What we learned
== We learned how to incorporate our classroom Java learning into a complicated mobile app.

== What's next for Laser Tag
== Laser Tag has a lot of potential for development of new features, such as a team mode or shields that are cast by turning the phone 
== sideways.
